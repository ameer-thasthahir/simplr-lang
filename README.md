# simplr programming language

## What is simplr
simplr spell as SIMPLER. It's a interpreted programming languaged developed using the nearley and moo library.

The intention of the programming language is to create a language which is easy to understand even for the layman.

the simplr doesn't contains any special keywords such as =, { }, (), ; just like any other programming.

## Why did you develop
I'm trying to teach programming language to my neice. She faced trouble to understand the special characters used in typical programming language such as =, ==, >, {}.

I just try to create a programming language which can be used as a side-wheel while trying to learn actual programming language for the atmost beginners.

## What is the speciality in simplr

the simplr programming language has a special feature. You can write the programming language just like writing a document.
Just like a typical document the functions are considered as a titled paragraphs.
classes are considered as name of the documents.
you can use full stops in each statement. just like semicolon(;) in typical programming lanuage.

You can use the **it** key word which hold the last variables reference. just like english grammar.
when you say,

"I have a pen, it is blue"

"assign 10 to a. add it with 20"

now the **it** in the second statement contains the value of 10.

Ex: 

**Assignment in typical programming language.**

```javascript
a = 10;
```

**it would be**

``` smplr
assign 10 to a.
```

**Loop in typical programming language.**

``` javascript
for(int i =0;i< 10;i++)
{
print(i);
}
```


**it would be;**

``` smplr
assign 0 to i. iterate it till 10. preincrement it 1 each time. use print with i.
```

**function declaration in typical programming language.**

```javascript
function print(a,b)
{
console.log(a,b);
}
```

**it would be:**

```smplr

title:print with a and b
    log value a and b.
```
    
**function call in typical programming language.**

```javascript
getUserDetails(a,b);
getUserDetails(a,b,c);
getUserDetails("Ameer Thasthahir",b,c);
```
**it would be **
```smplr
call getuserdetails with a and b.
call getuserdetails with a , b and c.
call getuserdetails with "AmeerThasthahir", b and c.
```

P.S: the programming language is still in development. My hope my vision will be fulfilled soon.
